Vibrating Detection System using Accelerometer.

The system consists of a sensor module that sits on an elevator that detects the vibrations using an accelerometer and 
transmits the data over a peer-to-peer LoRa. On the Receiver end we have a Raspberry pi that takes in this data and plots it on a graph.
We can both view and save the graph. The data received is saved into a test file as well.
