An unsigned 8-bit CPU that performs various ALU and shifter operations. The CPU is written in Verilog Language.
The hardware used was the Altera Cyclone V and the Software used was Quartus Prime.
The functions perfromed are listed bellow.

ALU Functions:
Transfer A
Increment A by One
Add A+B
Subtract A-B
Decrement A by One
Transfer A and Carry = 0
A AND B
A OR B
A XOR B
NOT A

# A and B are Outputs from the Registers

Shifter Functions:

No Shift
Shift Left
Shift Right
All Zero Output
Rotate Left with Carry
Rotate Left
Rotate Right
Rotate RIght with Carry

The CPU can also perform vaious memory access functions as well.
